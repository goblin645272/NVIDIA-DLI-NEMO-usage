Clustering of missense mutations in the ataxia[B] [I]- telangiectasia[I] gene in a sporadic[B] T[I] [I]- cell[I] leukaemia[I] .
Ataxia[B] [I]- telangiectasia[I] ( A[B] [I]- T[I] ) is a recessive[B] multi[I] [I]- system[I] disorder[I] caused by mutations in the ATM gene at 11q22 - q23 ( ref . 3 ) .
The risk of cancer[B] , especially lymphoid[B] neoplasias[I] , is substantially elevated in A[B] [I]- T[I] patients and has long been associated with chromosomal instability .
By analysing tumour[B] DNA from patients with sporadic[B] T[I] [I]- cell[I] prolymphocytic[I] leukaemia[I] ( T[B] [I]- PLL[I] ) , a rare clonal[B] malignancy[I] with similarities to a mature T[I] [I]- cell[I] leukaemia[I] seen in A[B] [I]- T[I] , we demonstrate a high frequency of ATM mutations in T[B] [I]- PLL[I] .
In marked contrast to the ATM mutation pattern in A[B] [I]- T[I] , the most frequent nucleotide changes in this leukaemia[B] were missense mutations .
These clustered in the region corresponding to the kinase domain , which is highly conserved in ATM - related proteins in mouse , yeast and Drosophila .
The resulting amino - acid substitutions are predicted to interfere with ATP binding or substrate recognition .
Two of seventeen mutated T[B] - PLL samples had a previously reported A[B] [I]- T[I] allele .
In contrast , no mutations were detected in the p53 gene , suggesting that this tumour[B] suppressor is not frequently altered in this leukaemia[B] .
Occasional missense mutations in ATM were also found in tumour[B] DNA from patients with B[B] [I]- cell[I] non[I] [I]- Hodgkins[I] lymphomas[I] ( B[B] [I]- NHL[I] ) and a B[B] [I]- NHL[I] cell line .
